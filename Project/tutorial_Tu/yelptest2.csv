    ","35.6400848,-78.837845",27540,"Fun place to grab a meal and a beer. Don't expect to have a quiet meal or a real in-depth conversation here because all the noise and TVs drown it out. The food we ordered was good. We started with the nachos, they were tasty. The half size was the perfect size to start with. There were three of us there. Then I got the cheesesteak, it was good. My husband got the wings, I didn't hear a complaint- he ate them all. And grandma got the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. She ate it all too. For dessert we got the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and it was really good. Service was good. It was hectic in there. We sat by the kitchen and I was able to peek in there and everyone was working and there was no horsing around. Good experience! Will return.,Honestly, it's typical pub food.  Nothing special here as far as food but the wait staff seem to be friendly and attentive.  I had gotten the house chips with my entree but it seems that there may be an issue with either their fryers or oil.  It seemed that they just mix two batches of the chips together, however, half my chips were that soggy/oily and the other half perfectly crisp.  Dixie chicken sandwich was just ok, again, nothing special.  One of my family members got wings and they looked delicious, however, I didn't get to try those out.  The cleanliness of the restaurant was not great, food all over the floor, at least in our area.  Time to get our food was pretty average, bout 15 to 20 minutes.  Honestly, if this this place was were to come up with something they are known for as far as a menu item (wings, burgers, ect...)  they have the location to become quite successful.,All in all:,Food 3/5,Service: 4/5,Atmosphere 3.5/5,Overall 3/5,I may check it out again another time but wouldn't go out of my way to come here.,Don't bother going here very disappointed ,the food is mediocre at best way too expensive for this type of tavern food very basic burgers are prob the best thing on menu. The service is horrible took too long to get our order 45 min to be exact,& there was only 3 tables in the restaurant. ,I'd give it half a star if I could we had to bring it to ,mgr's attention he did the right thing by taking ,off a percentage off bill., but this is the 2nd ,time this has happened here don't think I'll ,be coming back for awhile until they get there ,act together!!,Good atmosphere. Decent service. Okay food. ,Dropped in for a Tavern and Veggie burger at the bar over the weekend. (They had a 10 minute wait for tables at 5:30pm.) Good selection of beer, wine, and cocktails. Average selection of apps and entrees.   ,Beef burger may be fresh, but not the greatest quality of meet. Tasted and looked like a prepackaged patty from a grocery store. Definitely would recommend My Way, Aviators, or Mason Jar over this. Veggie burger was okay, nothing special. The sides were excellent...very good fries and broccoli. Ordered chocolate cake which was also very good. ,Would come again to try out their wings. Dozens of TVs so seems like a good place to grab a drink and watch a game, but just go in with low expectations for burgers.,Hickory Tavern is a wonderful addition to Holly Springs. The space is awesome both inside and outside. This is definitely a place that I would recommend catching a game at. On this most recent visit we were able to grab two seats at the bar to avoid the long wait. The craft beer selection was decent and the food was good. I ended up building my own salad and topped it off with salmon, a fantastic choice if you are looking for a healthier option. The salad was so large that Boyfriend had to help me polish it off. We will be back.,Three stars for now but hope to update again with a better review. ,The wait wasn't terrible and everyone was friendly. I like the text system to let you know when your table is ready. ,We were seated and ordered for our 16 month old who was hungry and put in an appetizer, 1/2 nachos. Also placed our order at the same time. Things came out semi-staggered. Our sons meal, nachos, then there was a loooong wait for our entrees. We ate the nachos which were good but toppings were literally only on top and there was quite a mound of chips. Then we waited. And waited. We asked to get our entrees to go as we were nearing the breaking point for our son. It wasn't a problem at all and our waitress who was so super friendly made sure everything was ok. ,I ate in the car so I could get our son to bed and my chicken was so tough I ended up not eating it. Kind of a bummer. We moved from Charlotte and frequented Hickory Tavern there and this didn't impress me at all - this was my faaaavorite sandwich and the chicken was really inedible. We got home and my husband had asked for a tiny bit of pink in his burger but it was pink all the way through and he mentioned his broccoli wasn't cooked. I could even hear the crunch of the broccoli. ,All in all we are happy this is here and will absolutely go back. Possibly just bumps in the road since it's so new.,Holly Springs has plenty of bar/restaurants but Hickory Tavern really steps things up a notch.  The food menu us amazing, I had the shrimp and grits tonight and it's the best I've ever had!  I chose the loaded potato as a side, but honestly this could be an entrée by itself.  Plenty of drink choices as well, both mixed drinks and draft beers.   The bartenders are wonderful and know how to mix a drink!  I'll definitely be back!,After an hour wait they finally sat us.  It was interesting to see multiple empty tables, some of which were vacant for approximately 20 minutes. One might suspect they were intentionally building a line/wait to make the place seem more desirable., ,I ordered seared tuna as an appetizer, which was prepared with an offensive amount of salt.  Once I scrapped the crust off the tuna was fine.,I selected a Ribeye sandwich for my entree my server asked what temperature I wanted so I asked for medium rare.  It was served with absolutely no red or pink meat at all!!  Why ask for my temperature preference if they were going to completely ignore it?  Additionally for the price I didn't expect such a thin cut of meat.,My wife ordered house made potato chips as her side.  Until tonight I have never seen a potato ship that could be bent, let alone folded multiple times.,I took photos and video of the issues.,I asked my server to mention the issues to the manager, which she did.  Sadly he couldn't be bothered.,I think the manager in the pink bow tie must be someone's brother in-law, otherwise I can't see how he could have gotten a job as a restaurant manager.,While I can understand ""misfires"" so close to opening night I have little tolerance for a poorly managed restaurant that doesn't bother to correct its issues.,I am unable to recommend Hickory Tavern in Holly Springs, NC and do not plan to go back.,Good beer selection,  10 local brews,  30 others. $4.00 Mimosas on Sunday. Great Father's Day experience! The bartenders are very attentive. Nice southern food selection. Bar foods are really tasty.,Lots of TVs. Not great food. Typical bar food. I expected better. Mozzarella Sticks are better from the frozen food section of the grocery store. BBQ chicken nachos were a nice twist on a classic, but I would have made them a bit different. Great idea though. My daughters mac and cheese was straight out of the Kraft box. We paid $45 for  a bunch of junk. Waiter sucked. Nice guy, but slow.,This Hickory Tavern location is not bad at all, but I like the Cary location bar area even better. The patio is very nice though. There are TVs everywhere at Hickory Tavern! The roasted brussels sprouts had a nice good crunch to them, just the way I like it. I also enjoyed the pretzel and salads. I always have wings when I go to a bar, unfortunately they were a bit mediocre here and the only thing I wouldn't really recommend.,Visited for an event.  Loved the huge patio with fire pit.  Lots of space to grab a drink on a pretty day, or rainy day since it is covered.  We were able to try a lot of the menu and while everything was good the stand outs for me where the roasted Brussels sprouts, all the salads, the Po' Boy and wings.  Staff is great and very helpful.  We look forward to coming back soon!,After waiting 25 mins to be seated, waited another 60+ mins for our food.  The family who sat down just before our group had actually finished their meal and been given to go containers before we received our food.  Not fun when you have kids and visiting grandparents.  You would thought the manager would have checked on us at least one.,The food was mediocre and sparse.  Ended up having to order my 12 year old more food (sweet potato fries) which they ended up giving to us for free for our long wait.  Guess the 50 cents worth of potato was suppose to be adequate compensation for the 1.5 hours of our time for forgettable food.,The facilities were decent.. but I counted over 30+ TVs playing various content.  So if you really want to ignore your family and staring at your phone isn't enough then you have plenty of other screens to provide a distraction.,To be fair, I really wanted to like this restaurant.  It is in a good location and has a variety of food options for the different palettes of my family.  But like a lot of franchises, it appears they are more focused on the facilities than the actual food.,Unimpressed to say the least.,The hostess is alone up front and slow, so getting a seat takes time.,Took time for waitstaff to come over and take a drink order; seemed like they didn't even notice me.,Ordered an Arnold Daly (mixed drink) and it lacked flavor. Very watery.,Ordered a mushroom swiss burger: Bread to burger ratio was 2:1. Bread was too big for the patty, which was cooked well and sort of dry. Mushrooms? 6 small slices of mushroom, maybe.,Fries were alright, but the plate was very big, so it all looked underwhelming.,Noisy. It's open from side to side and nothing to diffuse the talking, so it all sounded too much and with music on top of that, it wasn't pleasent.,If you're looking for someplace to hang out with friends and watch sports on their TV's that cover every open space above eye level, drinking beer (they have a lot) and snacking, this place will probably be alright. If you want a basic sit down meal, go elsewhere.,Didn't have a good experience.,I had the nachos and they were the only good part about the food or drinks.,The burgers were totally tasteless.,Never coming back..,Food looked and tasted very industrial.  Pretzels looked as if the were warmed from frozen and the chicken wings were uninspired and flavorless. Service was average. Dining area was clean and has potential. There are many better options for your dine out dollars.,We have gone 3 times since opening and everything has been great. Your good American eatery. Try the wings, they are finger licking good.,Very happy with our 3 visits here so far! Good service, consistent, good food & a large menu! Bar service is still spotty - some bartenders don't appear to be experienced, while some are pros. Hopefully they will weed out the novices behind the bar. They just opened in early May. Great patio area but I hope there are some sun shades on order :) Very happy to have HT in the Springs.,Love this place. Staff is friendly and food is amazing. We also love the outdoor patio. PLEASE GO TO THIS PLACE.,Wait was not bad for lunch 10 minutes to sit outside. Menu is very pricey for what you get. Ex. Handful of fries and a sandwich with no lettuce or tomato. Atmosphere was nice and clean but also new. Kids meals do not come with the drink with is rare to see I paid near $3 for an apple juice 3 oz can which was half the price of the kids meal itself. I will be going to My Way Tavern instead but worth a try.",3.0,(919) 557-2064,"

    ","35.720988,-79.181363",27312,"The locally sourced food was really delicious and I loved the special touch of a hand-crafted toy from a local craftsman for the kids.  Beats the heck out of the cheap plastic toys from chain restaurants.  I was really surprised at home affordable the prices were at Angelina's for locally-sourced food.  The quality was apparent and the price was really very fair. ,But the taste quality and friendliness of the staff is what will bring us back.  Thanks Angelina!,Angelina is the best.  From the moment I met her, she was so accommodating.  Her food is outstanding. I don't get there every day, but when I do it's awesome.,I'm a big fan of their bowl with slow cooked beef, veggies and rice.  It feels like healthy home cooking and is very satisfying.  The carrot cake and chocolate cake are killer good! My favorite place for quick and delicious takeaway too.,Good food!  My husband had a roast beef gyro and I had a falafel pita they were very fresh and good. The roast beef was so tender. My husband had the chocolate cake for his birthday, it was over the top good. The baklava (sp) was very good to. Nice little place and the staff are very friendly.,Angelina and her husband are both sweethearts. The food is local and delicious. If you want to pay $5 for lunch or dinner, go to McDonalds... If you want to pay $7 to $10 and get generous portions including local meat and produce, this is the place. I buy my husband dinner here a few times a week to bring home to him. And my 5-yr-old loved Angelina! Angelina let her pick a toy from the basket of wooden toys in the restaurant (she picked a giant handmade wooden duck and took it home and painted it). I made sure my daughter knew that she couldn't pick one EVERY time we came in lol. Angelina makes you feel instantly comfortable and her husband is just as kind. ,Hey we pay a little extra for local and for good meat. I'm fine with that. And their prices aren't even that bad actually.,We plan to make this a regular dining spot.,WooHoo!  The food is amazing!  ,The best tasting Greek style Chicken Soup in North Carolina!  The gyros are excellent, as are the rice bowls.  Angelina and John use local farmers and ranchers for her ingredients.  The food is so good, it is common to see the your local farmer and rancher dining here.,Angelina is a small town gem!  She loves feeding all of us and is so loving.  She nurtures are bodies and souls,Angelina's Kitchen was a quick stop on our way to the coast, but we were glad we stopped!  The gluten free pita was tasty and soft, their commitment to using local and fresh ingredients had us sold.  Even our picky 7 year old is a fan!  Affordable, tasty and healthy.,My parents, 3yr old and I stopped in for a late lunch yesterday. Very much appreciated how Angelina approached my son to get his order by asking what he liked. My father and I had beef gyros, my mother had Greek salad, and we shared the pappou tray. Everyone was very happy with what they got. The hummus was amazing, dolma were absolutely delicious! The quality and quantity of food was great. And Angelina came to sit with us for a bit, chatting with my son and showing him the wooden toys. This was our first visit to Angelina's kitchen, but between the food and hospitality we will definitely be returning.,Went to Angelina's Kitchen today before they opened. Angelina let us hang out and invited my 2 year old to play with the baskets of wooden toys while she explained the menu. She's funny and completely charming. We decided to try rice and veggie bowls, which tasted like slow cooked heaven. She claimed my toddler would like her lentils and (amazingly) she was right. Love this place.,Angelina's Kitchen is a solid pick in Pittsboro. My husband and I were staying out at Fearrington Village Inn for our anniversary and decided to get dinner in town, and we enjoyed our meal there. I got the Greek chicken soup and a salad, and he got a rice bowl, for a reasonable-to-slightly-higher-than-expected price.,It didn't send me home raving, but it did send me home full and satisfied.,Love love love the Greek salad.  I like to get a soup too. I couldn't ask for better food, local and made with love.,I think we met THE Angelina today ;)  What a gracious person, talking our 5yo through a particularly persnickety day in which nothing was quite right enough or came quite fast enough for her (when gramma GG is visiting, she's a handful).,She took a seat at our table and discussed culinary preferences with her like they were peers.  We loved it...and she got our daughter to eat her meal (and like it!), and agree to a salad lunch with Angelina herself at some future date ;),With a non-vegan guest in tow, we compromised to lacto-ovo-vegetarian and partook of the spanakopita/cheese pies, dolmas, Greek salad, lentil soup, baklava, and falafels and tzatziki, all of which was as lovely as our host.  For the gluten free among us, there were fresh specialty pitas and chocolate-coconut-oat blondies.,Pittsboro is a bit of a drive for us, so we bought some extra to go.,The restaurant is adorned inside and out by local artists.  It is located just off of West St (64W), one of the radial arteries leading to the town's historic refurbished copper-domed courthouse a couple blocks away.  Come see it in all its gilded splendour, before it patinas green.,Every time I've been here I've gone with the Greek salad.  Once with chicken, once with beef.  It's fresh, colorful, and filling!  On another note...best baklava I've ever had.,Disclosure: I am a regular at Angelina's Kitchen, so I may be biased.  I eat lunch here or bring my family for supper several times each week.  ,The ""sad, just sad"" reviewer must have been at a different restaurant, because the place I've seen over the years is nothing like that review.  From my perspective, there's nothing sad about this restaurant.  It is a locally owned, owner-operated restaurant, full of wonderful quirkiness, deliciousness, and foods exceptionally prepared with love.,I know of no other business that procures as much local meat and produce as Angelina and John do.  Others dabble, or brag about local procurement.  Angelina's shows the way.,100% of the meats are local -- I've met her farmers eating there.  And she features as much seasonally available produce as possible: In November when there are no local tomatoes, your salad comes with an apology and an explanation.,Angelina and John will not compromise and use the junk from Sysco's refrigerated trucks.  And sometimes that means the customer could be disappointed.  But those paying attention to flavor, nutrition, and story will never be disappointed.,Try the Avgolemono soup, and if you're there at an off-peak time (say 2pm), ask Angelina about it.  She will unfold with praise for her local egg sources, how the hens' feed effects the process of making the soup, and how to make a good bone broth (the base for her soup).  ,Angelina shares her recipes freely, because she really believes we should all be cooking at home and eating better.  (A cynic might say it's also because her foods are so labor-and-love-intensive that most will prefer to patronize her kitchen, rather than try them on their own. But in truth they're not so hard. I've made bone broth her way, and I'm a klutz!) ,Anyone struggling with food allergies or illness will find healing foods within. Celiac and gluten-free accommodations are made with real care, attention, and expertise.,Try it and decide for yourself.  And let them know it's your first time!,Angelina's Kitchen is not to be missed. I eat here several times a month, and I've never had a bad meal. There are plenty of options for vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Angelina's soups will cure what ails you, and the falafel is the best in the land. The baklava alone is worth a trek to Pittsboro. Perhaps best of all, most of the ingredients used are locally grown, Money spent here benefits local farmers and the local economy.,One of my all-time favorite places to eat; not just in Pittsboro but anywhere. It ain't fancy, and no one is wearing a tie (unless it's a tie-dye), but the food is fresh and delicious (and where possible, local!) and you won't find a friendlier bunch of folks -- not just Angelina and John, but their whole team.,I've eaten there or taken out a zillion times, and I've also benefited from their catering when my wife turned 39 for the second time...sparking more than one argument over who would get which leftovers!,Great menu, great folks, and lots of cool things not on the menu....local honey and preserves, art, super-cool aprons, etc.  And don't miss the incredible cheesecake when available!,Since moving out of North Carolina, I really miss Angelina (and John) and her (their) superb, home-style, Greek (and New Mexican) with a twist cooking.,Top things I love about Angelina's:,#1 - Friendly!,#1 - Awesome food with great flavor combinations,#1 - Real commitment to and focus on LOCAL foods,#1 - John's Frito Pie,#2 - bah, everything about this place holds an equal #1 spot!,Sad to say food has gone way down hill in last year-  let's see lunch for 2 - $20-  served in take- out containers - small servings-  not very fresh,     Passion seems gone- will not be back,This is an alright establishment. After reading the reviews for this place and seen it has 4 stars I decided to check it out. It wasn't awsome but it wasn't bad. I had the chicken gyro with hummus and olives and it was fair.",4.5,(919) 545-5505,"

    ","35.8196784324,-78.9010945335",27519,"Welcome to the neighborhood! We have been waiting for this place to open and finally got a chance to order takeout. The place was PACKED! ,Simply the best Italian food we have had since moving to Cary 6 years ago from NJ. All 6 of us enjoyed our dinner immensely.,I also appreciate how well the manager treated my son and his buddies when they walked to the shopping center from Mills Park Middle after the last day of school.,I've only been to Riccis for the take out pizza, and if the review was based solely on that, I would've given 5 stars on the review. Unfortunately, because of the owner/current manager of the place, I can't. Although the staff seems nice and more than happy to help, the owner seems the opposite. Recently when I went to pick up 2 pizzas, he was arguing with one of the waitresses about tips, right in front of me! The person at the register had to stop and talk to him instead of taking my order. ,I have no real problems with Riccis or the food they serve in geneeal, but there seems to be a real big problem with the upper management would hate to see this place fail because of the owner not being friendly and accomadating to his staff and customers.,Tldr: Great food, Great staff, but rude owner. Hope it gets better.,Middle to low end of our choice list.,Why?,Wifey's Fettuccini Alfredo presented well but was bland.  My simple pepperoni slice was light on the pepperoni even though I ordered extra and it was extremely oily.   ,Pleasant and efficient server!  Nice setting.  ,We'd go for a beer.   ,Doubtful that we'd return for a meal.,If there's one thing I learned being in NC, it's that you can never go wrong with shrimp :). I loved my shrimp fra diavolo. It had delicious heat and nice flavors. It was a bit heavy in the garlic, but other than that, it was perfect. Lots of shrimp. We also ordered the lasagna that was tasty as well but you do need to wait 30 minutes for it (as warned by our waitress).  The free creamy bread and melted butter was a nice touch - simple but it set the tone. We would definitely come back. Easily one of my favorite American-Italian places.  There was a short wait for getting a table (Friday night, 7pm) but it was worth it.,We've been here twice now since it opened a little while ago. First time was alot of waiting but they had just opened and I supposed the kinks were being worked out. Today was much better. ,I love the variety of items they have on their menu. Their appetizers are large and perfect for sharing and even as lunch by itself. Hubby is happy with the pizza slices at lunch and the fact he can try three different kinds (NY, Sicilian and Grandma's).  Grandma's is not as thick as Sicilian and has a touch of garlic and basil. ,The last time we were here I had the Carbonara. It was a large portion for lunch but creamy and chock full of peas which I love. We also tried their meatballs which were yummy. ,Today, I tried the Penne Alla Vodka and it was delicious! Sauce was amazing. Wished I'd added chicken when I saw it on someone else's plate. Lol. We also tried the garlic knots which were good and not crazy greasy. ,My favorite thing about it is their ""gravy"". They have a flavorful sauce which is how I judge Italian restaurants. ,I wish the outdoor seating had umbrellas as it was glaringly sunny today and I would have liked to sit outside. Overall, we are excited to have this new delicious place in our neighborhood!!,This just opened a few weeks  ago and I'm so excited to have an Italian restaurant option close to home. They renovated the space to include more seating. Outdoor seating is also available. We've tried the calzone, linguini with clams, and of course the pizza and garlic knots. So far we've really enjoyed everything and had good experiences both dining in and take out.,I find it hard to believe that some people complain about this place.  I lived in NY all my life and this is just as good ,IF NOT BETTER than most of the well known pizzerias in NYC!  Their grandma pie is excellent!  Great sauce!  Fresh cheese and amazing crust.  I live 25 minutes away and travel here to Cary just for good quality pizza.  We will definitely  be back as this is hands down the best pizza in the triangle.   Those that complain are probably use to dominos or Cesar's pizza...,I have no personal connections to the owner or the business, but feel it is necessary to dispute some of the injustices that are put out.. I wonder if this is sabotage/ vengeance by the competition.. SERIOUSLY TRY IT!,By the way, the owner is pleasant and comes out to visit his customers in between cooking which shows he really cares!,Great neighborhood Italian. I am so glad it is so close by! I have had the pizza and the carbonara so far there as well as the rice ball appetizer dish. Their pizza is truly NY style. Not as good but as close as you can get. The carbonara was a little watery the night I had it but I saw another review saying it was nice and creamy so maybe it was an off night. The rice balls are delicious and I can't wait to try some of their other appetizers as they all look great. I also tasted some of my hubby's spaghetti and meatballs and it was delicious too!,Dear ""Ricci"" -,Normally when writing a review about a restaurant the consumer does so about the food, the service, the logistics or other general restaurant critiques.  I don't want to do that in this case.  I want to write my review directly to you, the owner, Ricci, and review you. ,You represent everything wrong in small business ownership and should be ashamed of the way you treated your patrons this evening.  I could spend the evening and detail all of the typical restaurant faults that many others have found appropriate to criticize you for on other sites.  I could write about how you told my family and friends it would only be 15 minutes to sit us but instead it was over an hour and continually made excuses.  I could write about some terrible food that came out, despite the sauce actually being pretty good.  I could write about your inexperienced and un-trained wait staff.  Or I could write about how your bus boy Jamie is literally the only good thing you have going in that restaurant and should have your job. (sorry you have to deal with that circus, Jamie).   But as I said, I don't want to write about that -- I want to write about you.,Ricci's is a relatively new restaurant in the neighborhood.  I understand that.  You are going to have bumps along the road as you find your footing and I can appreciate that.  But what doesn't take time to learn is an appreciation for the customer and respect for the folks that are trying to support you and your staff.  At the end of the meal when we were provided an opportunity to provide feedback you didn't listen -- you attacked and defended.  I've never been so disrespected by a business owner in my life, regardless of circumstance.  You quickly found excuses and immediately turned the conversation against us -- your patrons.,If you have an off night on food or service I can understand it, but that complete lack of respect to a patron that is trying to provide customer feedback is very telling of you as an individual and a manager.  Your staff knows there are plenty of issues with the restaurant but it was clear that their concerns would be met with the same rebuke you gave the folks that ultimately pay your salary.  ,Clearly from your response and from speaking to your staff your management style is that of ""my way or the highway.""  To that end -- I'll see you next time right from Green Level Road as I drive past heading to spend my money at much more deserving locations.,We found this newly opened restaurant on Yelp, and the review is good, so we gave it a try. The salad is fresh and clean, the soup is homey, the pasta and lasagna are quite yummy, the tiramisu is spot on, and the service is also great! My husband and I are very happy that we have an Italian restaurant so close to home. We definitely will become regular.,Ricci's is one of the best Italian restaurants that I have tried here in the Triangle. Many local Italian restaurants feature french fries on their menu as a pasta substitute, which, in my opinion, disqualifies them from calling themselves an Italian restaurant. I had Chicken Scarpiello, which although fairly decent, was not cooked in the classic way of browning chicken parts. The chicken was sliced white meat, sort of like chicken tenders without the breading. Also, the sauce and sausage were far too salty for my taste. ,Why do I say this is one of the better Iocal Italian restaurants then? Because Ricci cares and knows what good Italian food should taste like. His vegetables are properly sauteed in the Italian style and his red sauce is not overly sweet or just canned. Ricci is so close to being the best that I hope he makes the extra effort not to shortcut a dish and give it its proper culinary historical due. ,Incidentally, the pizza looks fabulous and I will have to try it for lunch. I realize this is not a ""white table cloth"" restaurant but with the high noise levels and somewhat amateur service standard, I almost wish he would have a separate, ""serious"" dining room from the pizza eating hoards. ,Ricci, I am confident you will get to the top, just keep working at it and remember there are some serious lovers of GOOD authentic Italian food in West Cary!,EDIT JUNE 9, 2017: Tried a plain cheese pie for takeout. In the original review, I commented how good the pizza looked. Darn! The pie I sampled looked good but unfortunately, it was a fail. It appears that the pizza sauce, which is usually a simple very fresh tomato-ee sauce was actually a thinner spaghetti sauce. This is NOT appropriate on a pizza. Also the crust was very dry and tasteless.  Please, Ricci, work on your pizza recipe. The current version is not worthy of Long Beach, LI, NY!,Great Italian eatery.  Service was great and the food stupendous.  I had angel hair with a clam sauce and a lovely salad. Bread was fresh.   Cannoli dessert excellent.,Really enjoyed our meal at Ricci's. We ordered the Melanzana Rollatini and the Penne Rustico, both of which were delicious! Our food came out piping hot too which was a plus. The staff was very accommodating, our drinks never emptied, we were checked on often, and we watched as much of the staff worked quickly to clear tables post-meals. Cute atmosphere and kid-friendly! We will be back!,I sampled the spaghetti and meatballs  to evaluate the marinara sauce and the quality of the meatballs. What a pleasant surprise. The marinara sauce was thick, slightly sweet and delicious! The two large meatballs were made of high-quality ground beef, sumptuous and very filling. My friend raved about her lasagna, saying it was some of the best she had ever had and was even better after being warmed the next day.,       The menu is diverse with selections ranging from pizza to traditional Italian dinners to calzone and assorted  stuffed rolls. I have visited twice for both lunch and dinner with a dinner partner each time and every meal was remarkably good and the service was even excellent.,Absolutely delicious! You will appreciate how yummy everything is!,We've been back several times, and this will be our ""regular"" pizza place.,Try it! You'll love it!,I have nothing but great things to say about this place. Real Italian food, New York style pizza and great desserts all for a readable price. I am thankful Richie and his family relocated their business from Holly Springs to Cary Park. We have been in need of a local restaurant with a great atmosphere for quite some time. They also have great lunch specials!! ,My suggestion is to get there early on a Friday or Saturday otherwise you may need to wait...but trust me it's worth the wait!  ,Favorites are the personal pizza, Pasta Fagioli, Chicken Franchise and the Fruit de Maria.  Enjoy!,We tried Ricci's for the first time and had a very nice experience. Service was quick and attentive. The owner took the time to come welcome is and chat a bit - makes it feel like a neighborhood place 'where everyone knows your name.' Food was on target - we had Cesar salad, arancini, and chicken piccata. All very tasty. It's wonderful to have another quality option for a night out that's close to home !,The best Italian food south of New Jersey! We had the Frutti de Mar, Chicken Parm and Penne Vodka. Every bite was like going home to really good Italian food!,Great for what it is, family owned Italian joint.  I set my expectations appropriately, that pizza guy did not.  Pizza is great for the area, I probably would not take it to go just because it is best fresh out the oven. I have had 3 pasta dishes and a side of meatballs.  If you are looking for Fabio Viviani, go to Chicago and set expectations high.  If you are looking for a family style joint where you can chat with the owner and get a decent bowl of sauce check out Ricci's.,Waited an hour and half for a $16 PIE ! What a waste of time all you taste is acidic watery sauce with cheap cheese . The crust is just OK but no flavor ! Was really hoping they would be good.",4.5,(919) 380-8410,"

Because we had an awesome meal for super cheap in a really cute spot.,There are great sandwiches, vegetarian options and burgers for all kinds of eaters. The sides were the highlight of the meal (make sure to get the greens or mac n cheese), but the main dishes were yummy as well. My chicken salad sandwich was awesome, and my friends downed their cheeseburgers. It'd be a great place to take anyone with gluten sensitivities as well as they have gluten-free bread. ,The staff was sweet, speedy and they made some good recommendations. My lunch cost less than $10 and I was stuffed! Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Saxapahaw.,Something inside me told me to walk out as soon as I walked in, whether it was the rusty trailer out front, the questionable staff or the confusing menu....something just didn't seem right.,Prior to coming into this restaurant  I looked up the yelp reviews to make sure I was going to get a quality experience....sadly  I was deceived. From the high quality photos of the food (from inside the kitchen some how), I was excited to experience the restaurant first hand. ,After struggling through the menu, I finally decided on the Barbecue ""Sandwich"". Sadly, it was more of a a Barbecue Mini Slider. After about 3 bites, my meal was complete and I was left hungry, but with an empty wallet.,For the taste alone, I give this restaurant 2 Solid Stars. Try at your own risk....and watch out for the the rusty trailer.,Gross. My food was served in a tin slop tray. The gravy for my chicken looked like vomit. It was extremely thin and carelessly splooged into the tray bleeding into my mac and cheese. The stale gravy was unfortunately the only flavor the Mac and cheese had. The Mac and cheese itself was just plan, pale, flaccid noodles with a small amount of cheddar stingily sprinkled on top. It looked nothing like the pictures clearly modeled by the kitchen staff on yelp. ,While the chicken tasted alright, the side items and the horrid presentation made me nauseous.  I do not recommend this restaurant.,Lowered review to one star because restaurant appears to be posting fake reviews. Look at the content and times. Had terrible experience today and soon after posting there are positive reviews explicitly countering my statements. Little to no activity for about two weeks and then conveniently multiple positive reviews on the day they got a bad one.,A first impression would be that RFC is nothing more than a traditional American country cafe in the middle of nowhere. While it is true that the ambiance is that of a country cafe, the food is far better. I have never witnessed a chef with such creativity and flare to take country dishes to the next level. The cafe is rooted in the ""farm to table"" concept and they do their best to maintain that concept. Consequently, I believe we will find variations in their offerings as seasonal product becomes available.,I have never been to an eatery with a more friendly waitstaff whose main mission seemed to be making certain that customers enjoyed their experience.,Last night was our first time but it certainly won't be our only time.,Not only was our dinner delicious and locally sourced, but the staff was fun and happy at work. It was so interesting to learn about he local farms and bakers, and I appreciate the reverence with which the ingredients were treated. Love this restaurant and it's philosophy!,One of my absolute favorite places to eat. The food is always good. The flavors are always on point. I love how they cater to veggies that are in season and highlight those with their 'veggie of the day'. Probably to date the sautéed sweet potatoes and swiss chard is my favorite.  The staff are always helpful, polite,  and super friendly.   And I find for a farm to table, their prices are very reasonable.  (if you ever get a chance to visit the farm which is located only a few miles from here, it's also a great place). Totally a gem of a place located in the southern part of Alamance County.,We really like this place. Everyone is super friendly and the food is good. We have dined there twice and picked up to go twice. We will be back!,This place is a diamond in the rough, the  outer appearance belies the somewhat classy interior. The menu is comprised pleasantly  simple, very healthy, locally sourced items that  are well proportioned and delicious.,Well worth the drive! My husband had the meatloaf sandwich and it was awesome! We had the chocolate cake with strawberry filling and it was AmAZiNg, as well as the chocolate cookies; you can definitely tell these are homemade. Not only was the food great but the service was top notch; they even brought my 2 year old a coloring book and crayons to help keep him entertained. We will definitely be back!,A joyful staff brings you extra tasty, farm-to-table food. What else could you want? Great desserts, wine list, and beers to top it all off. Worth the trip.,Food was awesome and the service was great.  Don't let the location fool you. Once inside the atmosphere is very nice.  Great experience,Well, 'happy' would be an understatement. Stopped in here today for one of the best lunches I've had in a good while. Firstly, the owners and staff heard us asking questions about the farm pictures on the wall. They showed us around and explained the nature of their farm, etc. It felt like visiting friends. We ordered a burger with cheddar and fried egg as well as pan roasted chicken breast with greens and mac and cheese. The food arrived within a few minutes and disappeared into our bellies a few minutes later. Just great. The greens were wonderful with oil and fresh garlic. The mac and cheese was excellent too, but the burger was just out of sight. I was glad to hear that they'll be starting breakfast service in a couple weeks. I'll be frequenting here. Such a happy place, with a wonderful purpose.,By far one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  Farm to table and the chef is 5 star.  Come sit eat laugh love.  Moved to Mebane from Ohio, and I will be back regularly.  Just amazing in every way.,Stopped by Saturday for the first time had the meatloaf Great food , friendly staff and the food is straight from the farm.,Stopped by for lunch while running errands and had the meatloaf entree. It was THE BEST meatloaf I've ever had! The best flavor, was moist and very very tasty. My second time there and have loved the food and the welcoming atmosphere. Price was very reasonable too. Food was very fresh, all from farm straight to your table (literally!). I'll be back, even if it is our of the way!,Took three guests out for dinner after a very long day and we were told we had to stand in line to give our order; NOT what we were expecting.  I had the Brisket with the Veggie of the Day and their awesome Truffle Mac and Cheese along with that delicious Carrboro Coffee.  Two of my guests had Burgers with Homemade French Fries and one had the same as me, the Brisket platter.  Although one of my party was a bit complaining, we all cleaned our plates (I think he was a bit grumpy from the mildly lengthy time in line).  A little bit of a mix up in our orders too.  All this, with a large nod to their announced ""soft opening"", I give a 4 Star rating because two very important things that did not change were the quality of the food and the courtesy of the staff.,The food at this place is amazing! I really enjoyed the pulled chicken and we also had the ribs.,The truffled mac and cheese is to die for and the smokey pork and greens are delicious! I can't wait to come back and try more items. Everyone was very friendly and nice.,Had dinner there sat. They have worked very hard on getting the place ready. It's super clean and bright. its guite a change from the prior occupants. The menu offered lots of good food but not so many choices as to overwhelm a person. I had the beef short ribs. They were tender and had a wonderful wine sauce complimented with fresh greens and yellow squash. Both were cooked just right, not cooked to death as some places do. The prices are very resonable for the way the food is cooked and you have a choice from large to small portions. The waitt staff were most friendly. We are local and will surly return soon.

    ","35.7210302,-79.1768646",27312,"Ate at Virlie's last night. It is everything you hope for in a small-town joint. The food is quintessential down-home, country cooking, but not high-end farm table style, but ""as-good-as-grandma's"" style. We'd eat there again tonight but they are closed on the weekend. Burgers, fries, homemade chips and the STRAWBERRY CAKE!!!  This will be a repeat stop.,A bit slow during the Sunday Lunch, but hey, I'm retired. Wonderful people. Excellent food and I like the decor for Memorial Day. Big Flag in front window. I ordered a BLT and read about Virlie Pickel from East TN. Nice A/C and TV silent which I like. Lots of children and old folk. This is my first visit. I want to bring my grand kids,Virlie was born in 1898.,Quaint little cafe/diner. Portion sizes were HUGE! When I saw fried bologna as an option I knew it would be good! LOL! Being as that is one of my fav old school breakfast selections!,Everyone's meals were cooked as ordered, and all our plates ended up clean!,The staff was friendly and the place was clean (especially the bathroom!).,Stop on in!,Hubby and I celebrated an early Father's Day on Saturday. Got there early (8:15) and glad we did! By 8:45 the place was packed. All waitstaff were friendly, helpful and genuinely seemed to like their jobs-how often can you say that? Husband had The Hash Browns with the Works- / eggs on top of crispy hash browns, with peppers, sausage, crumbled bacon and melted cheese.  It filled the plate and he said it was delicious. I opted for the Biscuit BLT...also delicious. The tomato was ripe (!), lettuce crisp and bacon plentiful....biscuit was as good as mine at home and that's sayin' something. Wonderful home cooking in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. We will definitely be back.,Omg this was the best breakfast spot in North Carolina ,All fresh ingredient made to order family friendly environment. We decide to spend sometime in Pittsboro NC this was a diamond that was a great find,Virlie's Grill is yet another one of those quintessential Mom & Pop, Southern diners that I've always loved to visit, and continue to aggressively seek out. Usually located in small towns, there is often a friendly, old school charm to the people who work there, and a certain warmth and character to the restaurant itself that is missing in most modern establishments.,And then there's the food, a chance to find excellent country cooking dishes that remind you of your mother, your grandmother, and even ""Dinner On The Grounds"" type dishes. The menu here is not as broad as some, but they offer a daily special or two, a variety of salads and sandwiches, some typical plates and pasta dishes, and several fried seafood choices, and a full Southern breakfast menu.,We came here primarily for the Country Fried Steak (aka Chicken Fried Steak), which we ordered with mashed potatoes and Fried Okra. Chopped BBQ (described as slow cooked and tender) is also on the menu everyday so I opted for that, with FFs and Slaw, along with Hush Puppies. And since they offered a Hot Dog, I ordered that as well.,The time out of the kitchen was rather slow (25 minutes for a diner is slow), and the food arrived rather piece meal - the entrees, then the FFs, and finally the hot dog. The Country Fried Steak was excellent - a good quality piece of meat, well breaded, nicely cooked, and then smothered in an super white pepper gravy. The Fried Okra was perfect, and the mashed potatoes were fine after some salt.,The BBQ comes out with sauce on the side, and is a bit on the dry side, even when the sauce is added. The sauce is a thin, vinegar based one, with no heat, though there is commercial hot sauce on each table, and it is needed here. The meat had a decent flavor once sauced, and it was tender, and probably was slow cooked, just not in the last few days.,The FFs were very good, as was the slaw, and the hush puppies were perfect, for my taste, at least - nice outside crust, tender with a lot of flavor inside. The hot dog was outstanding - an all beef wiener loaded with excellent house made chili, making this a ""heavy"" dog, but one with plenty of flavor. It is a bit pricey at $2.50, but I'd get it again.  We also chose a piece of freshly made Strawberry Cake to go, and we tasted it, and it is superb.,Good, friendly service here, even as things got busy - our drink glasses were never empty. I would think we'd find our way back again - breakfast is said to be very, very good. And they gave us a discount because we appear to be old!,After kayaking on Lake Jordan, this is in reasonable proximity to be explored and provides a reasonable place to get reenergized with standard American food, such as subs and burgers with fries. Nothing special, nothing wrong, just the way they have to be.,Man, if all their fried chicken specials are as the two we had, I'd never return. I probably should have said something in that the two orders were completely overcooked and the chicken was as tough as a Firestone tire. ,All the breakfast reviews have me intrigued so I'd start a day there, perhaps.,Virlie's is the real Pittsboro.  Great homestyle cooking in a friendly atmosphere.  The servers do a fine job.  Not a hipster in sight.,Virlie's is a good bet anytime.  I like breakfast, because you can run into just about anybody in town at that hour.  The loaded hash browns are a big winner.  You will never run out of coffee.,Friday evening is a big deal: Steak Night.  They set up charcoal grills out back and cook three or four different cuts of beef to order, usually with some shrimp, too.  You may have a brief wait to be seated on Friday evening, but they move everybody through in good order and the servers run their butts off.,A refreshing lack of any pretentiousness whatsoever.,It makes me happy that a place like this still exists: a simple, old fashioned diner/grill...,We come here regularly on the weekend and they have not continued to maintain high standards as they grow. There is no system for equitably seating people when it is crowded and there does not seem to be assigned tables for the wait staff so we watched today as five tables that arrived after us got their orders taken before us. ,Until they increase their staff or put some systems in place, we will not come back.,Fantastic, superb, and the best home cooking within a million miles radius, except for my wife's and mother's cooking of course,  Exceptional service paired with their speed in serving is quite the surprise. Great food served quickly! I love their breakfast. The only dinner item I've had is the country fried steak. And that's only because it is so frigging good. Every dessert we have tried has been outstanding.  You cannot go wrong here.,Yummy breakfast. We sat by the window in this unpretentious but good food   good service,Fantastic food as well as exceptional service. One of the top two restaurants in Pittsboro. There's something on the menu for everyone.,One of the best restaurants in Pittsboro. I'll take a good diner fare meal here over a lot of other fancy food any day.,What to get:,- Tuesday night prime rib or fried chicken rotating special alternating weeks. Both are excellent! Delicious prime rib. Perfectly seasoned and cooked fried chicken.,- Thursday night fried shrimp / fish or meatloaf. Seafood is fried up calabash style and perfectly cooked...the best I've had in the area by far! ,- Friday night steak, garlic chicken, grilled shrimp, or salmon dinner. All are excellent!,- Soups...always good! Sometimes I get a soup and sandwich for a great lunch.,- Breakfast 7 days a week. Try the loaded hash browns and come hungry! They're awesome!,Add all that together with some really awesome folks running the place and you get one of the best restaurants in town! I love Virlie's and you will too. Go there!,This place was on North Carolina Weekend for a reason! The lunch here is really great. I love the subs and salads especially. Friendly staff and quick service. Prices are insanely reasonable.,We love their cheap and tasty diner breakfast food.  (Haven't tried lunch or dinner yet).  Prompt service every time we go.  A hit with locals, always packed on weekends.  Everything we've ever ordered has been great.  Coffee, omelets, pancakes, eggs, grits, sausage, bacon, hash browns--all delicious!,Virlie's was awesome!  Haven't been to Pittsboro in years and stopped in for breakfast. The smothered hashbrowns were outstanding!!!  Look forward to coming back.,Solid local place to stop by for breakfast or lunch.  The omlettes are very good.,My wife and I eat here a lot, it's always very good and well priced. Home style atmosphere , great service and great potions at a good price.

I will definitely be back and bring friends.,I really enjoyed the food, i went ti breakfast twice and lunch once, the egg-salad sandwich and egg sandwich were both really delicious. I am definitely going back soon.,Bed.  The ""bed"" part of Small B&B has been nearly overlooked.  There are 43 reviews for the Small B&B Café (as of today) and only nine of them make mention of the overnight stay part of the venue.  ,Quirky.  I can think of no other word for this place.  With only three rooms (two rooms and a guest house, actually) available for overnight guests, the Guest House, the Woodshed and the Treehouse, Small B&B proudly shows -- with a vengeance even -- the concept of ""repurposing"".  The building, the décor in the rooms, the garden sitting room are built and decorated with materials from something else. Both the Treehouse and the Woodshed, in their former lives, were part of an art gallery.  The Treehouse, despite its name and being the tallest building, is on one floor.  It's named for the tree carving on the wall extending to the second story.  ,The bathroom in the Treehouse is nearly the same size as the room and is separated by a large sliding door that reminds me of a barn door, but with fish shaped carvings  The walls in the bathroom and shower are old tiles, and although the showerhead is modern, it reminded me of an old school gym shower - only less grungy.  If you're claustrophobic, or have a big dog, the Treehouse is not the best room choice.,The Woodshed, about the size and shape of a small mobile home, has more space.  There's a small loveseat, a queen bed, and the same style of wall decoration as in the Woodshed, but placed horizontally rather than vertically.,The garden sitting room offers an escape from the sun but still in the outside air.  Unlike the rooms, this spot has plaques on the wall explaining the origin of the materials.,It's a pet-friendly B&B and a couple of short blocks away from the circle and the shops on Hillsboro.  There are no televisions, radios, or clocks -- at least in the two rooms in which I stayed -- but the wireless worked really well.  For a getaway where you won't be spending time in the room, or where you want some quiet to get away from the electronics, Small B&B can deliver. There are plenty of blankets and pillows for the asking; the rooms have their own heat/ac unit.  The owners and staff couldn't be nicer.  As part of its environmentally friendly spin, there are multi-use bottles of shampoo and conditioner in the shower, and disposable makeup remover towels to minimize the wear and tear on the face towels and keep costs down.  I guess that might be a cheaper option.,Small B&B is full of repurposed things, and for the adventurous, a change of pace.  Moreover, in B&B fashion, it comes with breakfast from the much-reviewed locally-sourced-food Café next door.  How awesome is that?,If you are looking to support or try local NC farm to fork restaurants, the Small B&B needs to be on your list. Most ingredients are locally sourced and the owners can often be found visiting the local farmer's markets. ,Much of the construction here is ""upcycled"", or crafted up from recycled products. Of course, this makes the atmosphere completely unique and funky or artistic. ,I have always found the service to be great. If you're new and not sure what to get, try the lemon ricotta hotcakes, which are awesome. If you don't like them, it is your tongue's fault. For lunches I just grab whatever the special is, and most recently that was a very tasty Bánh mì. ,The pricing is very reasonable to the high quality food served.,If you are new, be careful of the hours.,What an adorable place. Ate outside on the patio and it was so peaceful.  We stopped in while just traveling through and the staff was very welcoming to us outoftowners! I ordered the special which was a grit cake covered with sautéed veggies and two fried eggs and some slivers of Parmesan.  Hubby got the orange brioche French toast and thick bacon and scrambled eggs.  He was pleased with all if it and happy to know they only use real and fresh ingredients.  He hates fake maple syrup! Great little place to get breakfast or brunch.  Nothing fancy, but just good fresh food.,.,Unique indoor. Outdoor cafe with best breakfast in town. From ricotta pancakes to French toast with fresh fruit,A lovely spot.  Consistently interesting food served up by some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.  I really dig what they've done here.  Very pleasant atmosphere, two blocks from the circle.,Soon there will be an on-site folk art museum.  Not something you find just anywhere.,I haven't used their accommodations because I only live a few miles away, but I'm quite sure they are maintained and operated to the same high standards as the rest of the establishment.,Lisa and Dave and their staff put love into what they do, and it shows.,Great, private place. The staff--I'm not sure there's even a word to describe how great the staff were. Free breakfast...accommodating. I give five stars and recommend everyone, at minimum, meet the owners. They are wonderful people.,We stopped in after a visit to the nearby Carolina Tiger Rescue. The food was yummy and the staff was very friendly. The decor is eclectic and artsy, very comfy. There is shaded outdoor seating or indoor seating. The selection isn't huge (but is reasonably priced) and no table service means you may have to wait in line to get refills. ,Overall a lovely and relaxing Sunday lunch.,The hubs and I came here on Sunday for a late brunch. What a quaint little eccentric spot. The restaurant is in an old house, which I am assuming also doubles as a B&B. Lots of outdoor seating. It feels more like you are in a backyard than at a restaurant. When you walk in you will find the menu confusing. It is written on a chalkboard above the register and does not have any rhyme or reason to it. Might be better to ask the hostess what is good. He ordered the pancakes and I ordered a fried egg sandwich with arugula and tomato. Small portions but that was just what we were looking for. Flavored were great and my sandwich had heirloom tomatoes on it. Yum. Our meal was around $16 so very affordable. Ample parking in a lot outside the house. Quiet a lovely hidden gem in sleepy Pittsboro. We will be back.,Absolutely delicious. ,Truly a delight for anyone who will venture into Pittsboro. We drive there once a week from Chapel Hill, and we SPLURGE on brunch food. It's not always on a Sunday when we make it out there but the menu is always Sunday best. ,I would certainly call this place farm-to-table as I know they are using locally sourced foods whenever possible. From the fresh seasonal salads (which always are perfectly portioned and given delectable dressings) to the special main courses which can range from Huevos Rancheros (which always have quesa fresca and plump black beans) to roast beef, glistening with juiciness and balanced with greenery or their soon-to-be-famous smashed potatoes. Pancakes, hot cakes, french toast, scones, cookies, slices of chocolate ganache cake (or the like) can sweeten up the meal and they have a full range of tea and coffee. I HIGHLY recommend the iced tea. ,We have never stayed in the guest rooms but have frequented the cafe. Lisa and Dave's love of repurposing is apparent in the woody, industrial and funky decoration that charm the place. They also are true believers in local art and are starting an art museum on-site. Please consider donating to the project if you also believe it supporting local artists!,Outdoor seating is a delight when it's nice out, sitting beneath the pecan trees and amongst a well-tended garden. Indoors is also pleasant because the tables always seem to be available within a few minutes and have fun, mismatched chairs. ,Expect counter-ordering and table delivery.,Because they are self-run they are extremely accommodating. They know their limitations and they know what's in the food. They love to cook and it's so, totally obvious. ,They also apparently have a mountain cabin that can be rented during the year! ,Hooray for these beautiful people and their wonderful food. I will continue to come here until I can't anymore. Absolutely this should be part of anyone's Triangle foodie experience.,We love this place. The food is really fresh and delicious, and they use local seasonal items. It's small (if you couldn't guess by the name) so sometimes you have to wait for a table but it's worth it. We've never been disappointed with the quality of food, and the portions they offer are very generous. Highly recommend!,The staff were patient and considerate and respectful to my elder companion with very specific needs.  She never felt rushed and enjoyed her conversation with you!  Thank you for your kindness!  The food was wonderful.,Love, love, love this place. Good, fresh, local offerings. The smashed potatoes served with breakfast plates are really delicious. But it's their lemon ricotta pancakes that inspire me to drive all the way from Raleigh for brunch. They are fluffy little pillows of creamy, lemony goodness!,SUPER DELICIOUS! I had the French Toast and Smashed Potatoes and my mom had the Open-Faced Salmon Sandwich special! Absolutely delicious! Adorable place with awesome ambiance and great service! Will definitely be coming back!,OK.  I realize I'm a conventional looking guy, but if we dig deep enough there's a little tree hugger or Earth muffin in us all!,I freakin' LOVE this place!  The folks that run the restaurant and associated B&B are friendly, absolutely down to Earth, and WOW can they cook!  Totally creative dishes, fresh locally sourced ingredients, great coffee and BACON . . .,What a place!  Come here, kick back and soak up the food, beverages and the awesome vibe!  Eat BACON!  ,Next time we'll stay the night so we can eat more.,Great service, both friendly and personable. Food was fresh and reasonably priced. Eggs were too oily but otherwise it was a welcome oasis from the ice storm this weekend!,Farm to table, in the heart of Pittsboro. I'm so pleased that there is a brunch place in Pittsboro that has fresh veggies and thoughtful dishes! Get the lemon ricotta pancakes.,This is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsboro. Dave and Lisa 'get' good food and do it well!  When I want an awesome poached egg, this is the place!  They are great with any number of their daily wildcard specials.  Corned beef hash is awesome but so is the breakfast sandwich on naan.  Their bacon is amazing!,Desserts are awesome, especially the chocolate cake, if you are lucky enough for it to be available when you visit, however  about any dessert that is in the case will be enjoyable.  ,If you are looking for huge portions this isn't your place, but if you are looking for yummy, locally sourced, creative food that makes you smile, give the Small a try!,We've also stayed at the Guest Cottage and it is a wonderful place to stay; besides, you get breakfast--what's not to like?!,All local ingredients all served up by a fun and eclectic staff. ,Order at the window - look around the menu is everywhere.  ,Coffee is to the right of the order window.  ,The food is brought to your table, but you need to bus your own. ,Word to the wise - avoid the post church Sunday afternoon rush. ,Nothing here has disappointed- from eggs benedict, to granola, to their sausages all they way to their sandwiches and salads.  ,You can't go wrong with trying anything and everything. ,Parking can be a bit trying, but it's all well worth the wait.",4.5,(919) 537-1909,"

    ","35.721491,-79.177508",27312,"Family run S&T's Soda Shoppe is a downtown gem in the heart of Pittsboro. For lunch they have fantastic burgers (the pimento burger is my favorite), sandwiches, hot and corn dogs. ,Perhaps the best part is the ice cream. They serve oversized scoops of fresh made ice cream with a large variety of flavors. You will not want to miss this treat!,And the service is what you would expect from a small town business. Superb!,A very enjoyable soda and ice cream shop circa 1950.  Typical menu fare consists mainly of sandwiches and burgers, simple and well prepared.  The retro-setting is great, but the reason to come is the wonderful ice cream.  The sundaes are excellent, and the banana split is unrivaled anywhere...plan to share it!  Great spot with friendly staff.,omg amaaaaaaaaazing. Authentic retro feel, GREAT ice cream, enormous servings, and huge bang for your buck!!!,Definitely worth a stop in if you're in town... great food, desserts, and sodas for the money.  This place is exactly what I imagined small town America to be and I'm so glad places like this still exist and thrive.  I had a a cheeseburger and fries and it was solid and made to order as you'd expect from any mom and pop shop.  What got me was not only the great value but the decor of the place.  Situated in the small but quaint main street area this place really made me feel like I was back in the 50s.  Lots of great food options but I didn't even get to try their desserts and floats which looked like their main draw.  If I ever go back I'm heading straight there for a coke float which looked amazing !  Will return!,When I learned they had a version of the legendary Gambler served at The Rathskellar in Chapel Hill for over 60 years, I knew I was gonna have to try it. The owner, Steve Oldham, was a big fan of the Rathskellar, and especially the Gambler and the restaurant's other legendary dish, Lasagna. His family used to visit the restaurant almost every weekend as he was growing up in Pittsboro. The Lasagna is also on the menu.,Today at lunch, I ordered the Single Gambler ($15) which comes with a mound of steak fries, grilled onions, and exceptional toasted bread. The meat is skirt steak, and according to Oldham, the secret to obtaining the nice outside crust that defines both the taste and texture of the meat, is to cook it on a cast iron skillet, and the dish is served on that same, small cast iron skillet. You can order a Double or Triple Gambler, if you dare.,They nailed the dish - the meat though thin, was incredibly flavorful - the steak fries were excellent, as was the bread. It is as close to the dish served at the ""Rat"" as my memory allows. We also tried a Chocolate and a Strawberry Milk Shake ($4.45 each) and they were excellent, as well, and huge - neither of us could finish the shake.,This is a small, cluttered place with a definite retro charm. The people are friendly & eventually efficient, and the menu is rather broad, with all kinds of frozen treats, sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, salads, spaghetti, and of course the famous Lasagna. They also offer Cherry Smash, Coke/Pepsi Floats, Egg Creams, and even Root Beer.,Cool place, a real blast from the past from several places, several time spans. Closed on Mon & Tue.,This place was such a cute little spot for lunch! The BF had a burger and I had buffalo chicken tenders - the food came out hot and fresh. While they maybe weren't the best chicken tenders I've ever had, they were a solid choice. BF said the same of his burger. The service was also pretty good. While I don't know that I'd be back for lunch, what happened after is why I'd go back. Since we were at an ice cream shop, it was only fitting that we have some ice cream. The woman who helped us was extremely friendly and helpful. We were both able to try a few flavors before deciding on which ones we wanted. We each got ice cream in a cup (I can't remember which flavors, but they were both delicious) and wow. The cups were HUGE. SO MUCH ICE CREAM. Hard to complain about that,  but I'd suggest splitting with a friend if you want to do anything other than be in a food coma after eating. The prices were also very reasonable. Overall I enjoyed lunch here and if I were in Pittsboro I'd go back, but I don't think I'd go out of my way for this place (unless I was really craving some amazing ice cream!).,This is a quaint ice cream shop located in the heart of Pittsboro. It is reminiscent of a 19th pharmacy and the heavy and dark wooden cabinets used to house medicine. Now it is a soda shop with bar stools, antiques and smiley staff. You will find S&T listed as one of the best ice cream shops in the state in Our State magazine. The owners have a connection to the former Rathskeller that was in Chapel Hill and have revived some of the classic menu items. The menu offers food yet we just went straight to the ice cream. The flavors are listed on the wall and they also make fresh shakes and banana splits. I had a waffle cone with two flavors and it was a huge portion. Next time I would just get one scoop. I definitely got my money's worth and you can sit and order or just order at the counter and leave. I had chocolate and toasted coconut and both flavors were creamy and delicious. You pay at the counter and they accept credit card charges over $5. This is a great place to stop in after touring downtown Pittsboro and fun for all ages. I would put this on my list of places to visit in the Circle City.,I had the worst morning, disappointed by the Powers that Be, (SBE) rejecting my charter school application. ,I needed a break, and visited one of my best friends in her job in Pittsboro. She took me to ,S & T Soda Shoppe and I was enchanted and delighted by this charming eatery. This experience, got me out of my gloomy, grieving mood. We were surrounded by adorable early 20th century soda shoppe, chockfull of objects and antiques from other drug stores and soda shoppes from all over.  It's more of a time-machine than a eatery.  I was thrilled!    ,My friend also took me upstairs to their ""party"" floor....really a museum, filled to the brim with articles from the past 100 years of NC History.  I was transported back to a time, (perhaps a past life), where life was charming, community was your home-town.  It was incredible.  ,And I felt better.  Thank you Ann. ,The salad, pimento cheeseburger, and chocolate shake were good too!,Service was pretty bad! Walked in & was not greeted or acknowledged for about 10 minutes. Food was ok, didn't have ice cream but I'm sure that's what this place is all about.,The Ram's Head Rathskeller lasagna and Gambler live on!!  I had learn this information on the Internet and decided to see if it was true! My wife and I drove up from Atlanta and treated my mother and aunt to dinner (have to be in the door by 7pm to get served).  We were quickly seated and ordered custom limeaides & strawberry-aides from the waitresses. The drinks came quickly and we ordered right away. The waitress warning the lasagne would take 20 minutes and arrived moments after my aunt's Gambler. The food was equally as good as the service. At one point the waitress's son (who's part of the namesake) came by and chatted with us. Everyone was over the top friendly and welcoming. The food hit the top of the mark. We finished things off with delicious ice cream. As a side note, my 2 year old twins were with us and the waitress immediately brought them a plate of cheese and crackers.  We were impressed and so appreciative. From the moment we arrived to leaving this quant little soda shoppe felt like eating at home with family. We were all blown away by the experience and food. I will shout this place from the roof tops. Very well done! Last note, the pricing was very modest creating huge value. You're missing out if you over look this spot!,The food is on point here, but if you are not here in the off hours, it's so busy you'll be sharing a table with strangers and bumping elbows, again, with strangers. If you like you're own space, you have to time your dining experience here just right which may involve a lengthy wait. S & T is the fantastic alternative along Hillsboro St to the pizza places, but if it's crowded... we just get pizza.,Yum! Try the orange dreamcicle. The gambler and lasagna recipes from The Rat in Chapel Hill are on point. Other dishes are also really good but I confess, I usually get one of the above. Every time I've been the owners have been there which is a plus.,Been going here since I was a child ! I love everything this place has to serve . From the burgers , cherry coke , all the way to the delicious ICE CREAM !!! I'll always go back to S&Ts,This place is great - it was packed on a Saturday afternoon so a bit of the ambiance was lost on me trying to navigate busy servers but wow - the limeade and chocolate coke we stopped in for were total wins!,It's definitely worth another stop for a malt or cherry slush, yum!  I loved the decor - it reminded me of a little drugstore we had in my hometown.  ,If you're looking for a fun little day date - this is your place!,The food is great. The atmosphere is fabulous; full of early 20th-century memorabilia under glass at some tables and in cabinets, antique furniture, and old-fashioned tile on the floor. My favorite thing about this restaurant is the service. The people who work there are so, so kind. S&T's Soda Shoppe is a place of which Pittsboro can be so proud.,Finally got around to visiting after hearing about it for so long. Didn't try the sandwiches (which I hear are quite good) but tried the ice cream.,Haw River Mud was outstanding, as was my wife's sundae. Lesson learned - split the desserts. They are huge! Neither of us could finish. ,We didn't have dinner until 10:00 after having these desserts at 4!,My family and I have a lot of good memories here already, and we've only lived in North Carolina for six months. We took the grandparents here. My year old daughter had her first ice cream here (and went crazy over it). We came for my birthday.,The service is attentive and friendly. The bar is beautiful, with lots of dark wood and cabinets full of interesting antiques. There is additional seating upstairs for when it is really crowded.,Great place to go with the family. My biggest advice is to get their early. This place fills up QUICK! Their ice scream sundaes and shakes are made the way they are supposed to be. The banana split is 6 (yes you read that right) scoops of ice cream on a banana. The shakes all have 3 scoops of ice cream and they give you not only the glass with the shake but also give you the tin it was made in with the left overs. The other reviewers were right. The food is ok not great but you don't come here for the food. You come for the atmosphere and ice cream. The service here is excellent. The wait staff looks like high school kids and they were always asking if everything was ok and seemed to genuinely care about your experience. I'll definitely be back. S&T's is a great place in an other wise sleepy town of Pittsboro.,This place was just perfect. I loved the counter and their was plenty of dining spaces.  The line was out the door but did not take long.  The server was pleasant and quick with our food.  We ordered hamburgers and a root beer float.  Both were delicious in their own way.  I would rate the food a four but the atmosphere and throw back to the old days easily earns them a 5 star review.  We will visit again.,I've been coming here for many many many years, since I was a little girl. I love everything about this restaurant. I even came here for my prom dinner when I was in high school.,Vicky and Gene are the most friendliest people ever. They're so welcoming and sweet! The waitresses are very friendly as well so the service is awesome!,The food is so good, but their desserts are heaven! This will always be my favorite place to get some ice cream!",4.0,(919) 545-0007,"

    ","35.721547,-79.1773973",27312,"Best joint in town.  Good people, good chow, good beer, good liquor.,Bear in mind that they make all the food behind the bar, and don't have a lot of capacity.  They have a limited but interesting and tasty menu.  They even accommodate vegetarians and other undesirables.  It can take awhile to get your food, because staff is limited and they usually have to work very hard.  If you are in a hurry and/or want people to kiss your ass, go over to Raleigh and eat tapas or whatever.  Come to think on it, just stay over there.  They don't do frantic at the City Tap, and that's the way it ought to be.,The covered patio is wonderful.  A pleasant spot to hear music, or just to have a sandwich and a few drinks and unwind.,Yeah, sometimes people smoke outside the Tap.  If that's a problem, you're probably better off not being in a state that was built almost wholly from wealth generated by the tobacco industry.,We have given this place a couple tries but after today, we won't be going back.  That was probably been the worst service we have ever had at any restaurant.   Food was marginal at best, worst part about it was it took an hour and a half from the time we got there til we got our check, and they weren't even that busy.  It seems like if your not a regular there your put on the back burner.  Glad there are other places in town to eat at when we want to get out.,Came here for dinner after an evening at Fair Game Bev. This was the recommended spot so we figured we would give this a try. The service was lackluster at best. I think my dining partner was more offended by it than me but I still didn't feel like we were treated very well. Maybe only good service for regulars? Specifically, our server was unenthusiastic and inattentive. We went long periods of time with empty waters. The most offensive thing though was when I was asking some polite conversational questions about the area and she interrupted me with ""are ya gonna order something to drink, or not?"",Unacceptable. ,As far as the food, it is ok, which is why this place gets 2 stars instead of 1. If the service was stellar, I may be inclined to go back if I was already in Pittsboro. The guac tasted like the premade dip stuff you get at Trader Joes. The tofu Bahn Mi was an interesting veggie option for this kind of place, but you know, meh. These things? Forgivable. If you want me to come back, just don't be mean!,I realized while sitting at the bar at The City Tap that they have no kitchen in back. What you see is what you get and they make all of their sandwiches in front of you and that is why the menu leans towards sandwiches and easy-prep items. The beers on tap were from all over the county and parts of the State. There is a nice outdoor patio as well. We sat inside because it was so humid. The staff was really friendly and got us our drinks and lunch orders. I had the sandwich of the day with melted cheese and apples and delicious sauce. The side options are chips or bean salad. If you are a hot dog fan, get their hot dogs. They were delicious and come with the perfect toppings. The City Tap is behind the Soda Shoppe and a great place to stop while exploring the charm of Pittsboro.,We've tried 3 times and never again. There is one horribly rude waitress that ruins what may otherwise be a fun experience. We were hoping she was just having a bad day, but she was just as impatient and sarcastic each time. Three tables of people walked out after waiting 10 minutes. We said thank you each time she placed a drink on the table, or eventually brought our food, but she said nothing in response. When we asked a question, she actually rolled her eyes. Then, when my daughter reminded her about a side she ordered, the waitress actually said, ""I'm used to hearing please""!!!!! It was on - my daughter owns a restaurant and bar and would never treat a customer like that. We are not inclined to spend money to be treated that way, so, City Tap, we're finished trying.,Very disappointing:( I was so excited when I saw the vegan tofu sandwich on the menu- finding vegan food can be tough in North Carolina! But they were out of tofu, which basically left me with a carrot and tomato sandwich. The service was incredibly slow, and our simple meal of soup, salad and sandwich took over an hour to arrive to our table. Service was not only slow but with a bad attitude. It was an all-round bad experience and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,Went last night to hear a friend play at open mic. The place is clearly geared toward locals; good luck getting served if they don't know you. Large beer list and bar food. Music was in an outdoor area with clouds of cigarette smoke. CHILDREN in a bar, in the smoke, talking over the music, well after 9 pm. Open mic was run by 2 visibly drunk guys who kept yelling at the musicians and each other, or wandering away and not paying attention at all. Drunk guy emceeing kept finding ways of interjecting himself into the show. Drunk guy running sound sat talking and smoking with people all night. He had NO idea what he was doing so there were endless problems with feedback and hum. They made no effort to help the musicans set up, test their sound, get volume adjusted,etc. Several artists were really good so it's a shame the drunk guys did not serve the audience better. I was embarrassed for the performers.,Update: Received a ""compliment"" for this review that turned out to be a finger-wagging sermon, among other things insisting that the guy running the show doesn't drink. He was drunk when we got there and slammed back beers all night long. Maybe there's some other buy, but the night of October 19 he was the one in charge. Guy running the sound much the same.  It's a shame they didn't do right by the artists, some of whom were very good.,Solid choice for lunch, meal wise.  ,Very disappointed that all the phenomenal outdoor seating is wasted as a nicotine section.  ,Ended up having to walk past a line of happy chain smokers and eat inside in the dark interior.,One of my favorite bars. Excellent beer selections as well as price. Great outdoor patio area and awesome music from local bands. Food isn't bad either.,Seemed like local bar hang out, good beer choices.  Food was ok bar food. Another words they were a bar first and maybe hanging bar food place second.,Thanks Yelpers. Quick stop in Pittsboro looking for a decent place to have lunch. This little bar is fantastic. I'd be a regular if I didn't live 800 mi away. I had a pulled pork pita lunch special. It was absolutely delicious with a fair amount of heat - just enough to provide a kick to an already flavorful mix, including fresh guac, pickled onions, cilantro and cheddar. The ladies behind the bar added to the character. 5/5,The City Tap is a great little bar with an outdoor venue. ,They have daily lunch specials in the afternoon and an events calendar on their website which displays their live music events. ,The food is great and they have North Carolina brews on tap.,The beer is good, decent variety plus a few really good local brew staples.  People are friendly. Live music is consistently good.  Now for the food, this is where City Tap surprises me.  It's a tiny kitchen with a panini press and a crock pot.  And you know what, it works.  I've never walked away disappointed in the food. Nothing has been too salty, to bland, too anything.  The specials hit the spot every time.  ,Don't come in a hurry during a peak time.  It's a small bar with a lot of local regulars so it gets flooded quickly and takes a bit for extra staff to appear to help. Normal stuff for a small bar in my opinion. Nothing that takes away from my view that it's exactly what a local bar should be.,This place was great! I didn't have high expectations due to the other reviewers comments about out of town folks not being welcomed. I found that completely untrue. The bartender was helpful and personable. Even when the joint filled up and there were groups of people waiting (she was the only service staff, other than the cook) she remained patient and attentive to us. ,The location was really cute. They had a nice outdoor patio which doesn't receive service FYI so if you sit out there don't expect help. The beer was great. I think there was 8 on tap. All of it local from North Carolina and all but two were from different breweries. ,Food was awesome. I had the tofu bahn mi with the dressing and it was a seriously delicious vegan sandwich. For a divey type location in a small town to have a vegan option is absolutely unheard of. The ingredients were local as well. All of the veggies were fresh and crisp. ,All in all a perfect lunch after a day of exploring around Pittsboro. If we are ever back in the area I'm headed back to City Tap.,Terrible service. Went there on summer fest and it took over 30 minutes to get hummus platter which was basically hummus veggies and pita (not complicated) and a pretzel which they forgot the ham). Food overpriced for what you get.  They comped us a drink because of slow service, which was nice. Nice patio and clean bathrooms. Need more staff on a busy day.,For downtown P-boro you can't get any better than this.  ,It's a small spot yes, I'll give you that.  The food is prepped and cooked in an even smaller ""kitchen"".  ,The sandwiches are all quite good.  I've tried half a dozen of their sandwiches and not been disappointed.  The portions are hearty and the service has always been amicable and attentive.  Some of the notable apps are the Guglhupf cheese/ham and cheese bretzels, nachos and their hummus platter.  ,The times we've been there we've brought our newborn - yes we're that couple, but the staff has been accommodating and gone out of their way to be helpful.  ,Good seating indoor and out, easy parking.  The place is quaint with a cool vibe.  ,The beer selection on draft is all local - NC beer.  ,We're planning on heading out there at least twice a month to enjoy the daily specials and the local NC beer selections.,This was my favorite stop from a recent weekend in Pittsboro. The restaurant is tucked away on a side street downtown. There's both indoor and outdoor seating and live music was on the patio when we arrived. Indoors is a dimly lit, laid back, pub environment. Not sure if this is always the case, but there were only two employees on a Saturday night - a cook and bartender/everything person. Tjey were both super friendly and did a great job running the restaurant by themselves.,The food is extremely reasonably priced and very good. Two meals, dessert and a beer brought the bill to $22. Also enjoyed the stack of games to play.,All orders run through the bartender, there was no wait staff. While everything was flawless, we had our food in 10-15 minutes, I could see a really busy night slowing things down. Overall, if you're in the mood for pub type food in a friendly environment, I highly recommended.,I agree with what Nicole M. said about the beer selection and the bar food.  I liked this place enough to give it three stars!  (Perhaps I should award it a bonus star for no TV?),The City Tap is an intimate venue for live music.  We went to see Danny Gotham there on Friday night.  The acoustics were alright, although the ambient noise was a bit distracting - even though we were sitting just a table away from the 'stage.',The man working behind the bar was going full tilt, as was the one coming around to wait tables... but the layout of the joint (think ""shotgun"" house) made passage slow and... well, intimate.  ,They did a brisk business for Danny's performance.  It was my first time at City Tap so I can't gauge the difference he made to their normal Friday night traffic, but they couldn't have done any better - there were just no other seats available.,I wonder how that's going to play out in a week or two when he goes back there to play with a jazz combo?,Nestled in downtown Pittsboro, The City Tap boasts an eclectic mix of old-timey relics and contemporary art housed in a cozy, dim-light pub. On a Friday evening a friend and I walked in and sat ourselves at two of the few vacant bar-stools. The crowd consisted of locals and regulars, most of which were seated at or standing around the bar while a few took advantage of their tables or outdoor patio and seating area. Bartenders service the entire restaurant, so while large groups can more comfortably dine at the tables, they should still expect to make frequent trips to the bar to order drinks. The bartenders weren't extremely attentive - we had to ask for a menu and for prices of drinks, as they don't have a drink list. The crowd there seemed like they were all local to the area, and weren't exactly receptive to ""outsiders"" visiting ""their bar"". While people were fine with staring, no one was very excited to engage in conversation aside from a few party-of-ones at the bar. I definitely wouldn't suggest this place to people looking to go out and make friends and was glad I had went there with someone else.  , ,What they lack in service they make up for in their beer selection. I adore craft beer, specifically local or N.C. craft beer, and they had plenty of it. My personal favorite was called ""Thrilla in Vanilla"" from Double Barley Brewing out of Smithfield, NC. You'll also find bottled domestic and imported beer, white and red wine, and plenty of spirits (but no drink list, so you'll have to ask for prices, which is somewhat annoying to me). , ,Their food menu is small, but there is enough variety to satisfy both carnivores and vegetarians alike, and some menu items can even be made VEGAN... which is pretty hard to find in small town restaurants. We started with guacamole and chips; I'm a fan of guac that has a hearty texture and at least a hint of spice, and wasn't too fond of this super-mild version that was more of an avocado puree than a dip. For our entree, we chose one of the specials: a toasted pita round adorned with melty provolone and feta cheese, pear, pesto, and chopped bell pepper. After a short wait the bartender brought out our food on a paper plate and a near-religious experience ensued; the perfect combination of cheesy, sweet, savory, and just a hint of spice satisfied two very picky vegetarian palates. I should note that they feature local produce and ingredients, which makes all food better. We foolishly filled up on food and beer, albeit good food and beer, before noticing that The City Tap also serves dessert from the bakery across the street. ,The City Tap also had live music every weekends and open mic nights on Wednesdays. We stayed to listen to music on their outdoor patio after we finished dinner, but weren't too into the band so we didn't stay for long. However, if it were a good band (and a friendlier crowd) I'd definitely consider coming back for beer and music. ,Long story short, good food and beer, bad crowd and mediocre service. I'd call in for takeout but wouldn't say I'm planning on visiting again any time soon, unless extreme introvertism strikes.,City Tap is a fun, laid back spot for music, great local beers and an all-around good vibe. The food selection is small and may be a bit of a wait on busy nights but every sandwich I've tried is awesome. ,The inside is cozy, somewhat narrow & doesn't leave much walkway but in good weather, the outdoor area is always an excellent option. I would recommend a visit here for anyone wanting to check out some local music & local favors.",3.5,(919) 545-0562,"

We were immediately seated at a table and greeted by our super friendly server. She offered great suggestions and promptly brought out our beverages before taking our lunch orders. ,We started off with an order of their Panko Crusted Fried Green Tomato. The batter/crust hugged each tomato slice and offered a light crunch to the otherwise sweet and tangy meat on the inside. ,I enjoyed their hearty Citrus Chicken Salad which was dotted with grapes, cranberries, and bits of apple. If you're craving something a little sweet, give their sweet potato fries a try. ;],The staff are friendly, but were not very good about checking in on the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and regretted it. It was over cooked and barely edible. The sauce served with it was delicious.  The price is much too high vs the quality. ,The music scene at this place is fantastic with different bands every night. I would definitely come back for the entertainment, just wouldn't plan to have dinner. ,Update: this time I ordered the Mac n Cheese, it was very good even if over priced. The waitstaff was more attentive this time, but there were still long periods of time between visits to the table. The music of the night was wonderful, the Hollar and Shout had some awesome original music!,Our waitress and food were great! Highly recommend making a trip to try the Roadhouse out. We had the Carolina Calamari, shrimp and grits, macaroni and cheese, and the chocolate creme brûlée; all were fantastic! ,Their gluten free offerings are extensive, which is perfect for someone like myself with a gluten allergy and they didn't make me feel like a burden when asking for the gluten free options. ,I look forward to returning to try more of their gluten free options, especially the gnocchi.,I loved this restaurant and will definitely be back soon! Great atmosphere, loved the auto motif, and really enjoyed the food which was delicious. The wait staff were very attentive.  I can't wait to return! Don't miss this place!,I can see the potential of the building and atmosphere but food and service needs work. Easy and plentiful parking,Mother's Day ""brunch"" was an abomination.  Sausage gravy served with no biscuits?  Who thought that would be a good idea?  The rest of the sparse menu involved flavorless chicken marsala, mediocre BBQ meatloaf, and a rather bland paella.  , The regular menu was not available, though this was not disclosed to as we were seated, nor was the price for the buffet disclosed ahead of time.  ,This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  I will never return.,I was a little disappointed with the quality of the food especially supposedly one of their signature sandwiches. A burger in between two grilled cheese sandwiches. Very ho hum. And my dinner companion didn't like or dislike her entree either,This place is way over priced for the quality and service you receive.  My husband and I went here wanted to have a change of scenery, we are now at Hardees getting a burger if that tells you anything.  My husband did like the beer, and it was fairly priced.  We waited 30 minutes for our appetizers which were 4 little mushrooms stuffed with a 1/2 teaspoon of sausage 10.00, then we waited another 30 minutes for our steaks that were so thin it reminded you of a waffle house steak, a less than serving spoon of mashed potatoes and a few vegs. They removed the mushrooms, but we still paid 67.00.  Save your money.,The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived but the service was excellent. The server was very attentive and kept our water cups full. I ordered a mimosa and the Gouda mac and cheese as it looked delicious from previous reviews. It was okay- not everything I had hoped for but for the price I was expecting more. I would come back and try something else as my boyfriend ordered a burger which looked much more appetizing and the service was good.,Someone who works in Pittsboro recommended this place for dinner on a Tuesday night. Nice ambiance inside with young man playing a guitar on the side of the restaurant. Cute little gift shop tucked back from the dining area. Server was attentive. Got a free appetizer for checking in on Yelp. The chicken tenders came out very hot just as I like them and the batter was very light. I ordered the flounder sandwich and again the fried batter was very crisp and light. The pickled green tomatoes gave the sandwich a kick. The server gave my husband the wrong hamburger, and the chef came out wanting to compensate for it. The dessert tray looked amazing but we were full. They do have a gluten-free options with pasta and bread. A nice list of mixed drinks, wine and beer. Overall, a good experience. Menu was a little pricier than I thought it would be. Outdoor dining is also available with a beautiful view of the courthouse.,My wife ate there for our anniversary. The beer cheese soup was awesome. Met the owner and chef. Very nice. Had great time and meal.,I have to update my review with 5 stars based on tonight's dinner. I have never had a better steak. Cornmeal crusted whole flounder was incredible. Don't be afraid of the bones - there is lots of meat on this fish. We're fat and happy, and plan on making it back just to try the blueberry cheesecake.,Greg is the best.  His venue is welcoming and the food is fantastic.  Thank you for having The Band of Oz perform for your fans!   Fans of The Band of Oz, please patronize this great place. ,Carrie Peele,This is a great place to eat for lunch or dinner. They do change the Menu around from time to time. I loved the Turkey Burgers, which they no longer serve. ,Great entertainment, live band of all types. You can find Bluegrass, Folk, Blues, Rock, Classic Rock and more. ,This will surprise you , walk to the back and see why. ,Great local place to go. People are friendly here , you will have a good time.,Always loved this place, great food & atmosphere.  Aside from the awesome menu we have always been pleased with the entertainers they provide in the dining room.  Tonight it's a guitar player/singer.,The Pittsboro Roadhouse offers a unique setting with a more typical dining seating in the front of the restaurant, a general store featuring unique food and gift items from the area, a really nice and comfortable section offering thick-cushioned chairs for family and friends to talk and take in the wonderful decor, and then an entertainment view featuring ** Amazing ** acts from across the state and country with plenty of seating for small parties to larger groups. There is even a bar and outdoor seating. The food is great and the service is top notch. ,Pittsboro Roadhouse is the epicenter of PIttsboro and is a gem that is worth the short drive from the Triangle or elsewhere in NC.,This place is so great! Great setup for live music. Food was delicious. The service was also great. The only thing that could be considered an issue was that We asked to move our table when we were first sat down. Some of the tables were just too close (like NYC close), especially since we had a reservation for a special occasion. They even called to check if we wanted a table near the music or away from the music. They took great care of us! I am already thinking of when we can go back for another event.,Excellent. We had an incredible meal with live music by Eric and Lisa. I ordered the boil, the seafood was delicious, prepared in a rich and savory broth. My husband had the T-Bone and it was cooked perfectly. ,Excellent occasion, great waitress, all around wonderful experience and very affordable.  We will definitely be back!,I haven't been here since the change over and admit I still miss the old place, which had the BEST ice tea I've had anywhere!  There really isn't much that's the same here, except the stage and the sound system.,The staff couldn't be friendlier and the owner makes time to say hello to just about everyone and make sure all is well - and you can tell, he genuinely means it!  Nice!,We had the fish and chips, which were good, but not the greatest. I would have liked both to be crispier, but in fact they were kind of limp.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted very good, but in a limp kind of way.  The dipping sauce for the fish was marvelous!,We also shared a dessert, which was absolutely delicious!,It was a pricey meal, so a splurge.  Crisp up the fish & chips and it'll be outstanding!,Single handedly the worse dining experience I've had in the state of North Carolina. ,I visited this establishment years ago,  before the renovation.  My fiance is not from the area and I was anxious to show her this little gem.  We drove out from Apex. ,We waited so long with no server that the hostess made note of it,  still couldn't find us a server,  so she took our drink order.  When our waitress showed up we were ready to order,  having had enough time to memorize the menu in her absence.  Tom our order and poof,  disappears.  Finally after waiting over twenty minutes for our food,  a food runner,  not our waitress,  brought out,  barely warm food with the eggs cooked over hard instead of over easy. It must have sat in the window for quite some time.  Then, when she graced us with her presence again,  I asked for the check.  This establishment had wasted enough of our time.  She brought the check, I placed my card in it and AGAIN she's gone,  waited ten minutes,  a passing manager/owner?  Stopped and grabbed the check from me. ,Mind you,  this place was in no way busy.  Hardly anybody in the place,  no wonder.  ,I will not be back.",3.5,(919) 542-2432,"

    ","35.7269418,-79.1752021",27312,"I live 10-12 minutes north of Oakleaf and it's been a special occasion place for my wife and I as well as our out-of-town friends since it opened. Thus this review is based on eating there every 6-8 weeks for almost five years. ,It's easily my favorite local ingredient-centric restaurant in the Triangle and one of the most consistent places I've ever eaten. Lunch and dinner are always at a minimum really good and often excellent. Service is fantastic and attentive and the owners seem to be really nice people. It's hard to recommend anything in particular as the menu changes every few days but all the seafood preparations as well as the pastas are uniformly fantastic. , ,My only two very minor gripes are that 1) very rarely (like twice out of 30+ visits) there's a bit too much piling on of different ingredients on the entrees, obscuring the protein's flavor and 2) they won't bring back the oat cake nor the steamed lemon custard desserts (they were so amazing). Small qualms though, overall a gem of a restaurant.,We made last minute reservations for a party of 10 (3 of those were small children) for Saturday lunch this past weekend to celebrate my grandmother's birthday. Everything was perfectly executed and totally delish. We all shared a cheese plate (which was really, really beautiful) ordered various things from the duck confit to the hanger steak and it was all timed perfectly, and everyone raved about their food. This means a lot coming from our party- all of whom are usually critical in some way or another.,I really appreciated the fact that the kid's meals were just as thoughtful as regular entrees and didn't dumb it down for them. Also the service was spectacular, loved the fact they actually brought you clean silverware before each course and didn't ask you to keep your fork (HATE THAT). Cocktails, though a bit pricey ($22 for a whistle pig manhattan) were perfectly made. My only criticism is that they put a whole slice of orange in an old fashioned... I think that's more a southern thing though. ,Anyway, we finished off the meal with an earl grey creme brûlée and chocolate tarts which were absolutely on par with the rest of the meal. They sang my grandmother happy birthday and served her's with candles and wrote her a beautiful card signed by the staff. Really above and beyond and made her feel special. I am so glad to have found this place, now we have a new go-to spot! Thanks for a great meal, we will be back for more!,Wow what a delightful restaurant!  I went there for lunch with a group of 15 people.,The food was imaginative and delicious.  I had fried Brussel Sprouts and a goat's milk ricotta gnocchi with a brown butter sauce.  The sauces were light and flavorful.  The service was friendly and polite.,The setting for Oakleaf is an old textile mill.  The old wooden beams and wooden floors give it a relaxing ambiance.,This is an experience to savor and not to rush.  So give yourself plenty of time for your meal here and enjoy yourself.  This is a little gem in the country about 30 minutes south of Chapel and Durham.  It is well worth the trip!,I had been intrigued by this restaurant since driving through Pittsboro a previous time. This time, we decided to stop in. It was a Saturday night, granted, but when we went in, we noticed a number of empty tables. The hostess was not very welcoming. I said something like ""We'd like two for dinner."" She started to look through the list she had and asked what our last name was. It was very pretentious. I didn't have reservations, so I told her that. She said it would be about a 45-minute wait. Well, we didn't want to wait that long since we were driving through and hungry. She offered us seats at the bar. But the seats at the bar are low stools. Someone in our party has physical issues and cannot sit in those kind of stools. So we told her this person couldn't sit there, but she didn't offer an alternative. I don't understand why we weren't offered one of the empty tables. Even if there were reservations coming, we were already there. Anyway, I'm no longer intrigued.,First experience- well worth the drive (45 mins from Cary)!!  Very attentive staff.  Very rustic yet classy atmosphere.  Probably the most innovative dishes in the area.  From start to finish the freshest and most seasonal choices.  Can't wait to go back.,Went back to celebrate Lee's birthday- another great experience.,Oakleaf is a great example of why I started Yelping in the first place. I would not in a million years find this place on my own but at 4.5 stars with 84 reviews it made me pause. After dining here for lunch on my birthday I have come to the realization that I need more Oakleaf in my life. They are dining at its best. Unique food combinations, beautiful atmosphere, and impeccable service makes them bookmark worthy. Find a reason to dine here, make reservations on their website and you won't be disappointed. As Adam B. stated; The hype is for real.,Delicious food! We ordered the cheese plate which was just ok. While I like strong cheese, most of the cheese was very hard and difficult to eat and share. ,Husband ordered the Tile Fish and I had the Cheese steak dish. Both were awesome! I liked the fish dish better because of the sauce and veggies but both were impressive. Service and atmosphere were great. All the tables have a good amount of space between them so it was very comfortable. Highly recommend this place for special occasions. Price is good for an upscale restaurant. All entrees are around $25 but worth the money.,Another fantastic meal at Oakleaf. My fiancé and I shared several first course options and were very pleased. The NC grilled shrimp and crab app was just wonderful with a light but flavorful pesto and an aoli. My Harvest Salad with a honey vinaigrette was an excellent choice but the highlight was the pan seared gnocchi with a butter and white wine sauce and some wonderful grilled parsnips lurking within the bowl. Just delicious!  My fiancé had the tile fish with pistachio sauce and it was perfectly cooked and very flavorful. Cocktails were well made. Alexander was exceptional and very knowledgeable about each dish and and made sure we were taken care of all evening.,The management, staff, and food at Oakleaf never disappoint.,Some unique flavors, quite tasty. Small portions and overpriced. The menu & the service came across as a bit pretentious. Anyways, I think we'll explore other options the next time we're looking for a special spot to dine..,This wonderful restaurant in a reclaimed warehouse in Pittsboro is well worth the drive from Chapel Hill. My party of four shared a gnocchi entrée as an appetizer that was delicious. We throughly each enjoyed entrées of duck, scallops and rib eye. The desserts were fantastic!,I took my friends here for dinner tonight.  We had a reservation for 6 pm, but didn't need it--only one other couple was there and then four people came into the bar.  I'm not sure if they stayed for dinner or just had a drink and left.,Two of us ordered the trout with a butter bean and shrimp ragout, and the other person ordered the pasta with chanterelle mushrooms.  Everything was excellent!  For dessert we had the peach blueberry cobbler with blueberry ice cream--the presentation was beautiful.,Nice place, but very expensive.,3 stars tonight ,They close early (10pm) on a Friday.  We were seated at 9:30 and wanted to stay and enjoy your meal. They shouldn't have seated us and rushed to leave. Very disappointed tonight the attitude.,A wonderful restaurant.  They have raised the whole farm-to-table concept to high art.  All details of menu, presentation, service, and ambience are attended to.,It is worth driving a long distance to dine at the Oakleaf.  It is as good a restaurant as you will find anywhere in the United States.,Update 13 November 2016: Had to drop the Oakleaf to three stars, for two reasons.  One, they lost their excellent, highly professional bartender and hired a goofball to replace him.  Two, they have dropped their Wednesday night martini special, which was half-price on a particular brand of gin and vodka each week, underwritten by the liquor distributor.  That made it worth going to what is by far the most expensive restaurant in town for me. No longer worth it.,The hype is for real. Located in a reclaimed warehouse-y space off the main road into Pittsboring, this farm-to-fork concept is the true deal. Ingredients run the gamut from seafood to fowl to beef to all manner of vegetables and there was not a false step brought to our table. The cheese sampler is amazing, with four selections of varying types and textures plus a cornucopia of accompaniments. The tuna tartare was fresh and flavorful with lovely rolled cucumber ribbons and edible marigold blossoms making for a very distinctive flavor counterpoint that really worked. The roasted duck breast came with two huge slices (we nicknamed the duck ""Dolly Parton"") over a wonderful sweet potato puree with sautéed apple slices to provide some tart/sweet and seared Brussels sprouts to provide some texture. Service was smooth and the dishes were perfectly paced, which is a tough trick in a full house. I can't really find fault except that maybe the single-person restroom isn't quite enough for the size of the place. Speaking of the restroom:,Pro Tip: Do not place your iPhone on the back of the toilet tank, as it is a bit sloped and very slippery. Disaster may ensue.,Fine dining. Chef prepared farm to fork food. ,I see the chef at the local farmer's markets often. This is the same food I have in my fridge at home, but, they cook it a whole lot better than I do. ,My favorite is the chef's choice where they surprise you with a 5 course meal. ,Everything is prepared in house such as sauces and pastas. ,An asset to Chatham County.,Poor service and ok food for such an expensive location. We had lunch today two adults and two kids and between giving us the wrong menus, information, cancelled orders and normal food we paid a lot for such mistakes. It was quite a disappointment!! How can a restaurant list on their menus food or drinks that are not available.,Well worth the drive, I live in Pittsboro so I can go when every the need arises. The menu is extremely local so it changes frequently. So, when you arrive tour taste buds are open to a adventure. I always order off the main menu. This allows for a wide open adventure of taste and smells. Pricey but worth the price, if you are driving from afar make reservations.,Another beautiful night at Oakleaf where we seem to always end up while celebration a special occasion/milestone, in this case a birthday and promotion. Always professional, delicious and hospitable. Thank you again. Pro tip: get the Caesar. And pretty much anything else. You won't be disappointed.,This is where to go for foodie food, where the menu changes regularly and is prepared by master chefs using locally-cultivated ingredients. The service is very classy, the decor is modern and tasteful, and the food is delicious. Be sure to ask about what ice cream flavors are available. We had corn, horchata, and Nutella and loved them all. Yes, corn. Delicious. We didn't realize the restaurant is rather fancy because we just moved here and so we had our kids with us. They really take good care of kids; just keep in mind that it is the kind of place where kids REALLY should not be noisy. It would be a great place to celebrate an anniversary or graduation or to take someone whom you really want to impress on a first date.,From ease of reservation process to dessert this is a perfect place for a special dinner. Our waiter was wonderful and explained everything from the specific tonic made locally in Durham used in my cocktail to ingredients in each dish. All four of us were pleased with it all. Located in an old mill in historic Pittsboro it's a short 25 minute drive from Holly Springs. This we will be keeping on our list of favs",4.5,(919) 533-6303,"
