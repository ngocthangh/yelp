Don't expect to have a quiet meal or a real in-depth conversation here because all the noise and TVs drown it out. The food we ordered was good. We started with the nachos, they were tasty. The half size was the perfect size to start with. There were three of us there. Then I got the cheesesteak, it was good. My husband got the wings, I didn't hear a complaint- he ate them all. And grandma got the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. She ate it all too. For dessert we got the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and it was really good. Service was good. It was hectic in there. We sat by the kitchen and I was able to peek in there and everyone was working and there was no horsing around. Good experience! Will return.","
