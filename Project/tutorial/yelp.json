I wanted to like it, but I was so disappointed.\\n\\nFirst my boyfriend and I arrived and the hostess didn't look up. She answered the phone. Another group walked in, and she asked the caller to hold, and then seated the other group before returning to her phone call. They probably had a reservation or had gotten a text their table was ready or something. Ok, no big deal. Except for the fact the hostess didn't even acknowledge us. After hanging up her call she actually went to collect a check from a nearby table before finally speaking to us. She told us to wait at the bar and we would be seated shortly.\\n\\nWe didn't have long to wait to be seated but everything else took ages. Several minutes for us to be brought menus, several minutes for the waitress to bring water. When she did, we told her we were ready to order and she said she would be right back. She finally returned and we placed our orders. For my drink, I ordered a mango lassi. \\n\\nSeveral more minutes go by and we get bread and apps. No mango lassi. I saw our waitress walk by at one point and was relieved to see she was still alive as I had begun to wonder. Finally we flagged down someone and asked about the mango lassi and he finally brought it. Several more minutes. Food arrives. And then we don't see anyone for another long while. And repeat, ad infinitim. As we were leaving the hostess did thank us for our patience. Too little too late.\\n\\nAll in all the food was ok. I've had better. I was truly not impressed. How do you mess up saag paneer? To be fair they were extremely crowded early on but the place was practically empty well before our meal arrived. The busyness could account for the slow service but not the bad attitudes. Food was way too mediocre to justify the treatment. I am giving two stars because I think there is a possibility of improvement. And because there was nothing that would raise the eyebrows of a health inspector. I understand they are very new and maybe they'll get their act together. But I highly doubt I'll be returning anytime soon.\", \"author\": \"Katie S.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 4}, \"datePublished\": \"2017-05-08\", \"description\": \"Last Saturday night, we arrived at 7:30 and were greeted cordially and seated right away.  I loved the sophisticated decor.  The metal ceiling is particularly attractive.  The ambiance is romantic.  \\n\\nWe ordered a beer and it took a while.  The service needs some professional advice.  One person took our drink and appetizer order and then she disappeared.  Another waiter took our food order.  He seemed unaware we had ordered the beer.  I was going to taste my friend's draft and then order it if I liked it.  They never inquired so they lost that sale.   \\n\\nThe papadums were crispy and generous with the three usual chutneys.  I liked the tiny serving spoons.  The garnish with the veg. Samosas was outstanding.  It was an unusual combination of carrot and onion strings that had been pickled.  The Samosas were typically mostly potato with too few peas.  \\nThe saag paneer was a little salty. We ordered medium spicy and both dishes  could have had stronger spice.  The lamb shank curry was delicious but the ratio of meat to bone was way too low.  One piece was a real shank but was only 1 1/4 inches long.  The other piece was all bone and not shank bone. It was more  likely from the upper end of the leg.  The chef should have left that piece in the pot.  I brought the leftover sauce home and just added it to my own stir fry.  It was a great sauce.  The garlic naan was one of the best ever!  \\n\\nThe other aspect of the  service was that the waiter was so anxious to please that he tried to bus the non-empty baskets of papadums and naan.  I had to stop him.  This is the sort of service issue that an experienced waiter will learn, I think.  \\n\\nIt was nice that they offered us extra rice when they packed the leftovers.  We declined and I wondered if they had had an unusually slow night.   I would go on a Saturday night and not be afraid of a huge crowd.  \\nGiven the great recommendation from a friend, I was expecting a five star experience.  I am pleased they have opened in this neighborhood, and I will return to try the lunch buffet.    \\nIf it is a five, I will edit this review.

They have done a beautiful renovation in grays and whites, giving the long dark space a fresh, contemporary look.  \\n\\nWe got off to a rocky start explaining that there were only two of us now, but we would be four for an hour, but only the two of us would be having dinner.  With some further explanation we got it worked out and settled in tables by the open large windows opening on to Mass Ave. Note to staff: With the front windows open,  the tables, chairs and pre-set plates, get covered in gritty soot. \\n\\nThe bad news - The service is that maddening combination of lovely when you can get it, but usually missing in action. When we arrived at 6pm there was only one other table and it took us nearly 10 minutes to get someone to take our wine order and serve it.  And when they did, they knew noting about any of the wines on their list. We asked about two wines to compare and got a shrug. Our friends from California, who joined us for an hour, asked the bartender and HE knew nothing about the wines on their list either.  He actually said, \\\"no, I don't know anything about the wine.\\\" Okay we can figure it out but come on, you have a wine list.\\n\\nThe good news is that the food is quite good. The Vegetarian Platter was tasty if a little dry. My Goat Korma was spicy and delicious. My partner's Lamb Saag was also very good. Some of the most delicious Naan ever!

I was even more excited when I saw all the vegetarian and vegan options (they mark their vegan menu items and have something around 10 vegan entrees out of a total of 20 vegetarian entrees). \\n\\nThe space: Clean and modern with a large bar, comfortable lighting and a friendly staff. \\n\\nThe food: Excellent. I ordered vegetable samosas which were delicious. I followed that up with the Baingan Bharthha, which is like mashed eggplant with onions and spices. It was delicious and not something I'd seen before. The portions are huge so I took half home and a few hours later was already digging it out of my fridge for a second helping (I finished it that night). Each entree comes with a huge portion of rice and chutney. \\n\\nThe drink: They have a full bar including bar seating which can be rare at Indian places, so that was awesome. Although when I went they didn't have many beers on draft yet since they just opened, I was told that's coming very shortly so I look forward to that but what they had was good enough for me.\\n\\nPrice: Veggie Entrees range from 13-15 and I think meat is obviously a couple bucks more. That would be pretty standard HOWEVER the fact that it comes with a large side of rice and the fact that the portions are very generous makes the value really good.\\n\\nOverall: At long last I no longer have to travel to Harvard or Davis for my Indian fix and to be honest even if I lived in either one of those squares after eating the food at Nirvana I think I'd rather travel here instead!\", \"author\": \"James O.\"}, {\"reviewRating\": {\"ratingValue\": 4}, \"datePublished\": \"2017-06-11\", \"description\": \"I have driven by this relatively new Indian restaurant on Mass Ave many times and had made a mental note to give it a try soon.

The Shahi Aloo Gobi was served on a large heated caldron and tasted very good, but the chicken tikka masala was only on par with other competing restaurants (can benefit from more spice/heat).
